    <h1>To My Forever</h1>
    <p>Queen of my heart,</p>
    <p>
      One month ago, on June 26th, I asked you to spend the rest of your life with me. And in that moment, time stood still. Just two days later, we celebrated our one-year anniversary — a full year of laughs, hugs, adventures, and countless reminders of why you're the love of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will be honest, I find myself overflowing with emotions. You have stood by me through everything baby. The highs, the lows, and the moments I didn't even know how to put into words. You've loved me at my best and at my worst. You've been patient with me, pushed me when I needed it, and comforted me when the world felt heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you. Thank you for every little thing you do mi amor. You have a way of making me feel seen, heard, and truly loved. You are my peace and my spark all at once. I could not have asked for a more amazing fiancé. I hoped and prayed that one day I would find you baby and I thank god everyday for putting you in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don’t know what I did to deserve someone as incredible as you, but I promise to never stop showing you how much you mean to me. I will choose you again and again not because I have to but because loving you is the easiest and most beautiful choice I have ever made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our journey is just beginning mi amor and I can't wait for every step we’ll take together.
    </p>

      Forever yours,<br />
      Your fiancé ❤️
